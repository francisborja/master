I am happy to be here. To walk on this Earth. To live and love and, even many times, lose. And birthdays remind, they force to remember, that the sum of these moments, however messed up or ecstatically overwhelming, are worth living for. That after all these brief periods have swallowed us or dissipated and gone, it is a wonderful, beautiful, purposeful thing to have lived one more year â€” one more day.

Oh, the many years more.
