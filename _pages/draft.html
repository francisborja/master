<p>This election cycle has been one of the most polarizing yet infinitely inspiring depending on where you stand. For a lot of us, we have been inexorably made witness to changing tides, a movement started by a reluctant candidate who now finds unrelenting strength from being on the atypical campaign trail — run by volunteers with offshoots all over the country, a stark absence of traditional political machinery and unified financing, a campaign mostly run on foot without the deep, often conditional resources of vested interests. A candidate with no political ties save for a husband whose untimely and sensationalized death threw her into national recognition, her campaign banked on the limitless generosity of the Filipino spirit: frequently defined by its soft, forgiving nature and situational resilience, a word repeatedly abused to condition us into submission and forget the causes of our compounding crises and entrenched poverty, most of which are rooted in bastardized governance.</p>

<p>The campaign increasingly swelled in size, each rally flocked by more and more people, in many instances as a competitive response to the previous sortie's crowd estimate. The parades grew louder, echoing through unreached corners of the archipelago, the <i>laylayan</i> — fringes, pockets of communities rarely reached by mainstream government support. As election day grew closer, the fervor steadier and more resolute, people ask: what happens to this vigor after we've casted our vote?</p>

<p>The premise was mostly a sense of bittersweet parting from a campaign that's invigorated the nation that has for so long sat quietly as the world passed it by, a tiredness of fighting, of resisting, a surrender to the forces of fate and an approach to difficulty by just letting everything go. This resigned frame of mind has of course been one of the pillars for disinformation to stand on, a cunning and intoxicating network of lies to cleanse the former dictator's family of its violent past and rewrite the history of their barbarity to their own people.</p>

<p>The ideal response to the question is to sustain it, to make this election simply the opening of the floodgates. The right to suffrage may be the bedrock of a democracy, but an electorate is only as powerful as when it participates in nation-building as involved citizens after an election. We've witnessed many administrations fail, mostly by the sheer weight of their own corrupt ambition, but also because, in the grand scheme of working as a united country, many of us simply weren’t there.</p>

<p>Maybe that's easier to say than do as are most colossal responsibilities of a taxpayer. But what we've seen in this campaign is that these responsibilities are shared by all of us — a burden that is neither mine or yours alone. The truth is, the one real candidate who espouses unity does not pride herself in being capable of doing everything herself by virtue of her authority and instead recognizes her role as the first to lay the foundation, and asks all of us to participate, to take one brick each to rebuild the Philippines.</p>

<p>You've voted and your voice has been heard, now speak.</p>
