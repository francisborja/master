<p>This blog is meant to be a repository for all the voices in my head, all screaming to be heard, like futile attempts at social media fame. Things get a little weird here sometimes, but if you read my blog often or you know me in real life, you know that’s quite normal. Otherwise, this is just an ordinary blog with an overabundance of opinion&#8212;mostly so I can pretend I am as smart as I want to be.</p>

<p>I am a writer, designer and environmentalist. I am a selectively social ambivert, oscillating between textbook introversion and sporadic spurts of a desperate need to swim into a crowd. Go figure.</p>

<p>I am hand-coding this site with great obsession as this is somehow an extension of who I am: essentially a work in progress. This site will shift and warp and form psychedelic unicorn clouds when you're not looking. I've broken the code so often that I'm beginning to wonder if my site also has mental health issues.</p>

<p>I like taking <a href="https://instagram.com/freeingfrancis" target="_blank">pictures</a>, even when I’m nearly as much a failure at photography as I am at physics. I hate studying but I love learning, and I think an open mind is more indispensable than a diploma (but please stay in school if you’re already there).</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say go have fun reading, because introspection and the inexorable outward release of my soul isn’t necessarily enjoyable. But if I have made you understand or made you feel understood, and allowed you to feel the full spectrum of emotion, then by all means have a great time.</p>
